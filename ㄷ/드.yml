        You may not know what you're feeling when you feel it, but when
        the feeling goes away, you certainly feel the lack. Just so, you
        can easily come to miss someone when they've gone away.
    eg:
      - "You never know what you've got until it's gone."

        If the having of a thing is not good, then it is preferable to
