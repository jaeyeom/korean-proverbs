        If the master dies, there is no necessity to present oneself well,
        and so you don't go. If the master's horse dies, you must present
        yourself well to the master, and so you go. Thus, this speaks
        sarcastically of acting only when you can profit by others'
        good opinions.

        This says that they are detestable who outwardly pretend to do
        something for your sake, but slander you behind your back.
