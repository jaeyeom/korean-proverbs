        If struck by an axe, a person dies, but if pricked by a needle
        they suffer only a small injury. Thus, though a person with an
        axe cannot wield it recklessly, a person with a needle can still
        prick with it, and in the end the axe-wielding person cannot
        prevail over the person with a needle. These words thus
        suggest that there are circumstances where a stronger person
        cannot defeat a weaker person.
