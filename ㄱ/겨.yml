        This saying means that a person who has made a small error
        scolds a person who has made a larger error. Thus, the words
        ask how you, who have made a small error, can possibly scold
        someone who has made a somewhat larger error.
    ie:
      - "The pot calling the kettle black."

        This means that you just barely finished one difficult task,
        and then a more difficult task appeared.
    ie:
      - "Out of the frying pan, and into the fire."

        This means that because a thing has an order, it isn’t
        right to hurry it along.

    means:
      - >
        Even though many gemstones come from Gyeong-Ju, you cannot
        say that all stones from Gyeong-Ju are gemstones. Thus, this
        means that bad things can be mixed in among many good things.
